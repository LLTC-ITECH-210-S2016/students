This assignment is designed to help you get used to using GitHub and the sometimes mysterious and confusing world of Git.  The goal here is to familiarize you with the most popular and powerful version control system (VCS) in the world of software development today.

Here is the basic workflow that for completing this assignment:

1. Fork this repository: [![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/badges/shields.svg?style=social&label=Fork)](https://github.com/LLTC-ITECH-210-S2016/students#fork-destination-box)

Repository for practicing doing pull requests. Introduce yourself via a `GITHUB_USERNAME.json` file under the appropriate [`_data/TERM_YEAR/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. Here's an example:

```javascript
// _data/spring_2015/SirYancy.json
{
  "emoji": ":sunglasses:",
  "introduction": "Instructor of Information Technology."
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own `emoji` (choose from [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)) and `introduction`.
